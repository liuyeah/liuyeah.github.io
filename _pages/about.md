# üë®üèª‚Äçüéì Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and a member of State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence. My supervisor is Prof. [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). Previously, I interned at _ByteDance - AI LAB_, as an algorithm intern. I received my Bachelor degree from USTC in July, 2019, and majored in Electronic Information Engineering.

Currently, I am a visiting Ph.D. student with Prof. [Xiaofang Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaofang-zhou) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

**I am on the job market the next year!** I will graduate with my Ph.D. degree in summer 2025. I am open to faculty/postdoctoral positions or related industry roles. Please get in touch!

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](../personal_cv/CV_YeLiu.pdf) (August 2024).

# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Research Interest
My research interests encompass a wide range of subjects within the Ô¨Åelds of **Knowledge-aware Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, focusing on two main areas: (1) Knowledge Acquisition and (2) Knowledge Application. Recently, I am exploring a focused research direction of Knowledge-enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs). I have published more than 20 papers at the top international conferences/journals.

- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Acquisition of knowledge concept, knowledge relation, knowledge linking and alignment using information extraction, crowd-sourcing, and LLM In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques.
- **Knowledge Application**: Application of extracted knowledge in various NLP downstream tasks, including but not limited to: Hierarchical Text ClassiÔ¨Åcation (HTC), Multimodal Summarization with Multimodal Output (MSMO), Question Answering (QA), etc.
- **Knowledge-enhanced LLMs**: Mitigate the hallucination problem and elicit complex reasoning ability of LLMs with the integration of internal/external knowledge, mainly through the approaches such as pre-training and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
